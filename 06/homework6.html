            <p><b>Question 1.</b> What are JavaScript browser sniffers?<p>
            <p>JavaScript browser sniffers are JavaScript programs used to determine the brwoser, version and operating system of a visitor. Different browser's implementation of JavaScript varies a lot, and certain script has different behaviour on different browser. By executing such script on user agent, the browser and version can be determined.</p>
            <p><b>Question 2.</b> Why are they so commonly used in javascripts?</p>
            <p>Visitor's browser may be incompatible with certain features, such as CSS and DHTML. By determine the browser and version, webpage builder can display an error page or disable part of the functionality, thus enhancing user experience. Also, different browser has all different JavaScript implementation. By detecting the browser and version, this issue can be avoided by providing code for different platforms and let sniffer choose which to execute.
