        <h1>My Favorite Manga and Light Novel</h1>
        <p>
            I'd like to list some of my favorite mangas and light novels here. They not only are great entertainment to me, but also change how I think and live.

            I really like them!<br>I really like them!<br>I really like them!
        </p>
        <p>
            I love them so much that I have to use the &lt;br&gt; tag to break the line!
